      " Birminghamâ€™s roadways accommodate a steady flow of traffic in and out of town on a daily basis. The people who pass through the city may be miles away from home by the time they arrive here, and miles away from where they need to be. Not everyone who passes through our city is able to reach their destination on their own. Sometimes, things take a turn for the orse, leaving travelers stranded and often times desperate. This is when Travelers Aid is able to intervene, helping to make a plan to resolve the crisis and get the traveler on their way again.",
